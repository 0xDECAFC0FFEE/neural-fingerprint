% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Predicting the properties of new compounds requires a representation of molecules that allows generalization.
Currently, such representations are based on hand-coded features such as the Morgan circular fingerprints, which have [various limitations].
We introduce a set of fingerprints based on convolutional neural nets which generalize commonly-used fingerprints.
