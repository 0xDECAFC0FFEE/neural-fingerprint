% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Predicting the properties of new compounds requires a representation of molecules that allows generalization.
Currently, such representations are based on hand-coded features such as the Morgan circular fingerprints, which have [various limitations].
We introduce a set of fingerprints based on convolutional neural nets which generalize commonly-used fingerprints.
\end{abstract}



\section{Desirable Properties of Molecular Representations}

\begin{itemize}

\item invariant to global orientation
\item invariant to atom re-labeling
\item invariant to the SMILES representation (at the very least)
\item NOT invariant to reordering locally (maintain information about the orientation)
    example:  fragment1 - C - O - fragment2 is not the same as fragment1 - O - C - fragment2 
\end{itemize}




\section{Related work}

\subsubsection{Fingerprints}

[Cite Morgan] and \citet{ECFP2010} developed extended circular fingerprints.
These fingerprints map identical molecules to the same set of fingerprints.
These same fingerprints have been pressed into service as a measure of similarity.

However, for a meaningful measure of similarity, 

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}

Convolutional neural networks have been used to model images, speech, and time series\citep{lecun1995convolutional}.
However, standard convolutional architectures use a fixed computational graph, making them difficult to apply to objects of varying size or structure, such as molecules.
More recently, \citet{KalchbrennerACL2014} developed a convolutional neural network architecture for modeling sentences of varying length and structure.


\section{Experiments}

[How much is conceptual purity worth?  We can try using only topology, or include lots of hand-engineered features that we think will be useful.]

\subsection{Datasets}

\subsection{Interpretability}

[Idea: Use nested dropout to allow a variable-sized descriptor.]

[Wishlist: Include figures showing which fragments maximally activate different features - hopefully showing that they correspond to interpretable, familiar concepts]
