Neural Molecular Fingerprints
=============

<img src="https://github.com/HIPS/DeepMolecules/blob/master/montage/20141009-color.png" width="600">

This software package implements convolutional nets which can take molecular graphs of arbitrary size as input.
These are useful for predicting the properties of novel molecules, and are designed to be a drop-in replacement for Morgan or ECFP fingerprints.

The paper describing the algorithm used is:

*Learning Molecular Fingerprints with Convolutional Networks on Graphs*
